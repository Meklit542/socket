## **Title
   Simple Java Socket Programming Project
## **Overview
   This project demonstrates a basic client-server application using Java socket programming. The server listens for incoming client connections, and once connected, it can receive and send messages to the client.

## **Prerequisites
  Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
  An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## **Getting Started
  Clone the repository or download the project files.
  Open the project in your IDE.

## **How to Run
   javac Server.java
   javac Client.java
  1. Start the server:
     java Server
  2. In another terminal or command prompt, start the client:
     java Client
 The client can now send messages to the server. Type messages in the client's console, and see the responses from the server.
